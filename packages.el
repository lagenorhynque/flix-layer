;;; Commentary:

;; Spacemacs layer for the Flix programming language.
;; - Uses flix-mode (https://codeberg.org/mdiin/flix-mode) as the major mode.
;; - Starts the official compiler (jar) as the LSP server through flix-mode's
;;   public API.
;; The Flix LSP server loads the whole project on initialize, so no manual
;; file registration is needed.

;;; Code:
